airspeed velocity
=================

**airspeed velocity** (``asv``) is a tool for analyzing and visualizing
Python benchmark results over a project's lifetime.

Given a directory of stored benchmark results (JSON), it can generate
an interactive static website for exploring performance trends, detect
regressions, and compare results across commits.

See an `example airspeed velocity site <https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/>`__.

See the `full documentation <https://asv.readthedocs.io/>`__
for more information.

The latest release can be installed from PyPI using::

    pip install asv
